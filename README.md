## WeatherAndMore

Includes a weather-based website, as well as a city fact searcher. Also includes a model to view the Earth's relative position to the Sun and Moon at the given date and time. 
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
